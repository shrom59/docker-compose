# Docker Compose Infrastructure

## Overview and Configuration

This repository contains Docker Compose configuration of my homelab.
The infrastructure uses Traefik as a reverse proxy for handling routing and SSL certificates.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template
3. Update the `DOMAIN` variable in your `.env` file with your domain
4. Deploy services with `docker-compose up -d`

### Environment Configuration

This project uses environment variables to protect sensitive information:
DOMAIN=example.com

### Notes

- SSL certificates are managed automatically by Traefik with OVH as a DNS provider with DNS challenge.
- Configuration files in the `traefik` directory are excluded from version control
